# Noa Zec

I'm attempting to make a pseudo Zelda clone, which should include a background, obstacle sprites, character sprites, enemy sprites, and some sort of health system.

## Components/Sprites:

- Enemies
- Player
- Boss
- Area specifics 
* Stretch
- Items
- Secret Areas
- Dungeon

##  Models:

- Enemies
- Player
- Boss
* Stretch
- Items
